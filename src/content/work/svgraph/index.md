Implemented from scratch with Scalar Vector Graphics:
* Compute and visualize the frequency-variant, time-invariant response of the circuit (Bode plots - phase, magnitude)
* Compute and visualize the frequency-invariant, time-variant response of the circuit
* Sample input signals as mathematical functions and output as discrete points to be plotted
