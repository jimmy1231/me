synopsis: Signal Flow Graph Overlay & Visualizer
---
The function of the Circuit Schematic Visualizer is to render each circuit component at predefined positions and orientations. Separate sub-modules were created for each unique component including: resistor, capacitor, dependent/independent voltage & current sources, wires, and ground nodes.

The SFG Overlay solves the curve-generation problem by employing a heuristical variation of BÃ©zier curves, a polynomial interpolation technique where a curve is procedurally generated based on a set of predefined control points.
