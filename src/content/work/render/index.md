This is my first attempt at using OpenGL to render 3D graphics. OpenGL is a difficult library to learn from the onset, and this was a consistent challenge. Here is a list of features currently present:
* .OBJ file processing
* Per-fragment Blinn-Phong Shading
* 2D Textures
* Shadow Maps - FBOs and 3D Textures

As this project is ongoing, I hope to expand to include:
* World generation
* Animations
* Water: Animations + Reflections
* Skybox & Environment Maps
