Traveling has always been one of my conundrums: while I'm at home, I hate the idea of it - I'd honestly be more happy to spend a
week or more at home playing video games, and getting on with my routine; at the same time a part of me knows that I'd regret
that decision; that it's just the introverted, pessimistic, and sheltered side of me taking over; that I'd miss out on the
possibilities of adventure, exploring places I've never been, meeting new people. Or perhaps that very thing which entices me
about travelling is what has caused me to put off or throw away many a fantasy of venturing into the unknown.

Finding the motivation to travel, and more broadly to do anything outside my comfort zone, is a struggle. Luckily, when travelling
with others, finding that extra motivation becomes much easier. When make plans together makes it feels more real, so provides that
extra level of commitment, especially when you feel your companions are committed as well.

## The Journey
This holiday season, my parents and I drove from our home in Oakville, Ontario to Tampa, Florida. A long way, right? Yup! it's
around a 1400 mile drive that crossed the Eastern States of the U.S. that took 3 days to complete. First to Windsor, Ontario to cross the border into the United States, then
along the spiny, winding interstate highways, through 7 states - Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Georgia. Many stops were
made along the way: we spent a few hours at Top Golf in Cincinnati, sharpening our swings and slicing some drives into the net, then spent
the night in a nearby hotel, paid a visit to Georgia Tech while passing through Atlanta, and had KFC in Kentucky (the food was mediocre, but obligatory).

In the span of a day or two, we felt the temperature get warmer, mounds of snow get smaller and smaller, then disappear altogether,
leaves slowly appear back on trees, grass turn from dry straws of yellow to blades of green, and the world transform from the grey
and brown palette of winter to a vibrant mix of green and blue. It was magical, and definitely a unique part of the drive - something
we wouldn't have experienced had we instead taken the plane.

Once arrived,
