## Let the fireworks begin!
Every year, the countdown comes to 0, the clock moves to midnight, the ball drops, the proverbial curtains are drawn to the year that was, and a new year is ushered forth. People gather en masse, with their families, friends, and loved ones to celebrate the past year for themselves, each other, and for humanity as a whole. Friends clink their champagne glasses in toast, lovers share a kiss, a sea of thousands of bright-eyed people, some wearing top hats, others looking ridiculous in party glasses twice the size of their heads, share in the energy of the moment and in each other's company, laughing and gazing in wonderment at the scene of bright lights around them, as Sinatra blasts 
from the speakers of Times Square, serenading the New Year upon the confetti-filled, fireworks-lit night sky of New York City.

This year, I celebrated at home with my mom and dad. We cooked some pork sinigang (a really tasty Filipino dish) and slurped down some fresh oysters, then watched the ball drop while sipping on some white wine.

With COVID, I think the past 2 years have been especially hard to find much to celebrate about. But amidst the difficult times, I think it is important, if not to celebrate, then to reflect and acknowledge the significant moments of the past year, and make goals for the next year, so that we do not repeat our past mistakes, and so we can go into the New Year with purpose and determination.

So, I'm writing this post to set my "New Year's Resolutions", and also so I can capture my emotions at this very moment, while the rose-tint on my glasses are still fresh. To help with that, I picked some [questions people commonly ask themselves for the new year](https://www.thinkrightme.com/10-self-reflection-questions-to-ask-yourself-for-the-new-year/), and also added some questions of my own.

### What, in the past year, am I proud of myself for?
* Started swimming almost every day, which has done wonders for my mental and physical health
* 

### What was one of the biggest pleasant surprises?

### What are the 5 things I'm most grateful for this year?
1. My family - mom and dad. They've supported me this year through some tough times, as they always have.
2. My friends, whom I've reconnected with after years.
3. Myself, for being strong and humble.

### What were the biggest struggles I faced this year? What did they teach me?
I'm 25, and for 6 years been in one relationship to a girl I thought I was going to marry. We broke up in September, after mutually agreeing there were some irreconcilable differences that would have ended our relationship sooner or later. 

### Who will I connect with more in the year aheadh

### What kind of leader, peer, friend, or partner do I want to be?
### What are 3 things I want to achieve this coming year? How can I build a system that allows me to do that?
### What’s one thought I’m currently holding on to that’s not serving my well-being? Why am I holding onto it and what empowering affirmations can I replace it with?
