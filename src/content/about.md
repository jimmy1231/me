Hi there, my name is Jimmy! If you're here, hopefully I've made an impression on you! A bit about myself: I'm a recently graduated Computer Engineering student from the University of Toronto, Canada.

I've worked mainly in the web development industry. For my 16-month Professional Experience Year (PEY), I worked for FutureVault inc., developing key aspects of the company's backend infrastructure using AWS technologies. For instance, my largest contribution to FutureVault was the research, design, and implementation of many mission-critical technologies during the company’s transition to AWS and Serverless. Much of the code which I authored began as proof-of-concepts which were later approved, deployed, and have since been functional in production. As well, I co-authored 4 SDK/library-level software packages in Java and JavaScript; of which, 2 were mission-critical and have been deployed to production. Under direct guidance from Senior Solutions Architect, Mark Tyborowski, I hold the majority credit on the complete redesign and reimplementation of FutureVault’s core document processing model, migrating from a monolithic application to a more scalable and distributed Serverless model using Serverless technologies such as AWS Lambda, Step Functions, Cognito, API Gateway, S3, etc.

A bit more about me: My main topic of interest is systems design and optimization, which deals with the scalability and efficiency of programs at the hardware and compiler level. As well, I apply and hone my skills on a variety of personal projects ranging from simulation tools written in C, to web SVG rendering engines written in HTML/JavaScript. While coding, I like to follow strict guidelines and best practices to maintain readable , scalable, and consistent code. These guidelines are, of course, constantly evolving as I learn from my experiences.

From the projects I've done, hopefully I've made the impression that I am passionate about software. I am always looking for new, cool project ideas to expand my knowledge, and this portfolio will be updated as I complete more projects in the future.

Thank you for taking the time to read through! I hope you will be kind enough to reach out and we can talk about anything software, or otherwise :)
